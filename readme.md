# Astro Starter Kit

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template tornarus1/astro-template
```

Basic Astro 5 project template with TS, Prettier, and Oxlint/ESlint set up OOTB.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project structure is similar to that of a default minimal Astro project, but
with the extra `prettier` and `oxlint`/`eslint` config files.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page
is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                        |

| `pnpm build`       | Builds your production site to `./dist/`      |
